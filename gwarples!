gwappe;!

question for hole, when shall we introduce it? should it be after 500 gold for example? maybe after a certain amount of miners/gold per second? - elliot

it would appear after an arbitrary ammount of time, like 10-15 minutes. it would be like a notification that appears on the top of the screen, saying something like "you found a hole!", and you click on it, and it takes you to a new screen with likea picture of a hole, and after a second a button appears that says "dump all your gold in the hole." and you do. at wich point you are presented with another button, reading something like "return to the mines" and it basically looks like everything reset (and then we start to introduce things)
